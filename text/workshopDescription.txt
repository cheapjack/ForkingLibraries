Ross Dalziel will lead a workshop about how to make and distribute Interactive Fiction and Non- Fiction through the writings of librarian and writer Louis Borges using tools like Twine http://twinery.org/. We will make simple games that could be applied to encourage reading, browsing and discovery in library spaces.

We will make a virtual library based on 2 of Borges stories, "The Garden of Forking Paths" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Garden_of_Forking_Paths and "The Library of Babel" https://en.wikipedia.  org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel
